# Users SPA vanilla.js | Homework

## Install project infrastructure
`yarn install`

## Start client with in-memory service
`yarn dev`

## Service
It's used in memory service for storing users. To setup the remote service it's necessary to fill `BACKEND_URL` value in the `./src/config.json` file.

Note: haven't checked it yet. Definitely it should be checked on live service.

## Tests
Will be added soon...
